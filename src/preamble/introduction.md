# Introduction
# Perl üíé and Its Experimental Features üß™

This book describes how to use [Perl](https://www.perl.org) and its experimental features.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone interested in discovering and harnessing the experimental and cutting-edge features of Perl for efficient and modern code writing. You should have a good foundation in at least one high-level programming language, and be familiar with software development principles. You don't need to be an expert in Perl, but some experience might be helpful.

Don't know any Perl/Python/Java/Ruby yet? [Start with *Learning Perl* first.][learnperl]

We also assume basic minimal knowledge of Functional Programming, at least familiarity with "map" and possibly "filter" and "reduce".  Don't have that?  You can learn about [map, filter, reduce with examples.][learn-fp]

## How to read this book

You should first read the next section [why perl and what's changed][why-perl], which covers why perl is like a new language now, and its key new features.

The [tutorial][] is written to be read from start to finish. You should follow along: writing, running, and understanding the tutorial's code yourself. If you haven't used Perl's experimental features before, do the tutorial!

The [following sections][whats-next] may be perused in any order.

> **üí° Tip:** You can search through this book by clicking on the üîç icon at the top of the page, or by pressing the `s` key.
